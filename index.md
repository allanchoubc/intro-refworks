RefWorks is a web-based citation managment program that enables you to download, store, and share references, and format bibliographies in seconds. 

UBC Library maintains a site license to RefWorks. It is freely available to UBC students, faculty, staff, and alumni. We currently support both the Legacy and the newest version of RefWorks. You can learn more about both versions on the ProQuest website.
