RefWorks is a web-based citation managment program that enables you to download, store, and share references, and format bibliographies in seconds. UBC Library maintains a site license to RefWorks. It is freely available to UBC students, faculty, staff, and alumni. We currently support both the Legacy and the newest version of RefWorks. You can learn more about both versions on the ProQuest website.

By the end of the session, you will be able to:

- Collect and annotate references
- Organize references using tags, folders, and other features
- Collaborate and share references 
- Generate citations and bibliographies
