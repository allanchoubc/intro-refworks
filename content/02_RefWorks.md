RefWorks is a citation management and bibliography builder that helps collect, organize, cite, and share research. Create reference lists in APA, MLA, and other formats, and organize your citations with tags and collections. UBC Library maintains a site license to RefWorks. It is freely available to UBC students, faculty, staff, and alumni.  By the end of the session, you will be able to:

- Collect and annotate references
- Organize references using tags, folders, and other features
- Collaborate and share references 
- Generate citations and bibliographies

## NOTICE: 

Systematic downloading or harvesting articles, citations, metadata (e.g. using citation managers such as EndNote or Zotero) is strictly prohibited. (You must contact lib-license@lists.ubc.ca. Permission is required or a Text and Data Mining Package should be purchased.)
